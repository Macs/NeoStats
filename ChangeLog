   have includes available. (M)
 - StatServ: complete rewrite of statistics systems. (M)
 - Very basic stats added to core for debug, reported in STATUS command. (M)
 - Fix up memory leaks and missing list/hash clean ups. (M)

* NeoStats * Version 3.0.prealpha1
 - First recommended release to devlist only as prealpha1. (M)
 - New moddata API. We now have two values for use by modules, one being an 
   allocated address and one a value. This allows the core to clean up after
   modules in the event that they fail to. (M)
 - RTA support has been moved back itno the core rather than being a module. 
   It did work fine as a module, but was limited to providing core info only
   since there is no module <-> module communication at this point and created
   module depedencies. Making this a module will be looked at again at some 
   future point. (M).
 - HostServ: Improved ban handling. (M)
 - HostServ: LEVELS command removed since core now handles this. (M)
 - All commands now have a configurable minimum user level using the command
   /msg botname LEVELS. (M)
 - HostServ: moddata use removed in favour of a simple flag in the core wrt
   user SETHOST from NeoStats. (M)
 - HostServ: BANS DEL now takes host as a parameter not an index. (M)
 - HostServ: DEL and VIEW now take nick as a parameter not an index. (M)
 - StatServ: add option to configure html update interval. (M)
 - Add support for persistent bots which do not auto leave channel when it is 
   empty. (M)
 - Remove NETINFO event. Not available on all ircds and useless since the 
   ModSynch call will let a module know the network is synched. (M)
 - Make joining services channel a SET option so people can prevent NeoStats
   bots joining the services channel. Generally, the bots can message channels
   without being in them. With them not being there means we can drop 
   chanalerts when the channel is empty and save a bit of otherwise wasted 
   bandwidth. (M)
 - USERDUMP etc commands changed to USERLIST etc to be consistent with similar
   commands. (M)
 - StatServ: updated to use core side kill types. (M)
 - ConnectServ: updated to use core side kill types. (M)
 - Process kill types within the core. (M)
 - ConnectServ: add logging facility to log events. (M)
 - Channel alerts for command use is now optional. (M)
 - Automatically remove NeoStats bots from channels when there are no longer
   any real users in the channel. The services channel is excluded. (M)
 - Add neousers counter to Channel structure for tracking our bot counts in a
   given channel. (M)
 - Core command processor can now handle channel message commands e.g. !help
   using the standard command tables. Command char is selectable via a SET
   option. (M)
 - Add new timer type TIMER_TYPE_COUNTDOWN. This is a one shot timer that 
   deletes itself after it has triggered. (M)
 - Initial import of Language Functions. Two Macro's to use now, _(x) is for
   default language, and __(x, Client*) is for user/channel language
   settings. (F)
 - More portability wrappers for file access since Win32 DLLs do not appear to
   be able to use fopen etc locally. This also means we can look at using more
   optimal Win32 native file processing calls. (M)
 - NeoStats alloc/free functions updated. (M)
 - Begin adding portability functions for file system calls, socket management 
   etc to make it easy for modules to be Win32 compatible. (M)
 - Remove all SqlSrv code from core in preparation for moving to a module. (M)
 - Alter CODERHACK dependency so it only requires a rebuild of auth.c rather 
   than potentially a reconfigure and full rebuild. (M)
 - Change UserDump and ChanDump to use prefmsg rather than chanalert and remove
   calls during error conditions to prevent flooding the services channel. (M)
 - Extended and optimised mode support. (M)
 - Ability to enable/disable events so that a module can "optimise" it's event
   table based on options e.g. disabling ConnectServ sign watch can disable
   the SIGNON event core side. (M)
 - More flags added to event system to allow the core to automatically handle
   exclusions of NeoStats clients and global exclusion entries. The module can
   manipulate the current settings based on local options. (M)
 - Add error field to Module structure so the core can flag a module as being
   in an erroneous state and unload it at an opportune time. E.g. if a module
   calls init_bot from ModInit, the call will fail gracefully and the module 
   will be automatically unloaded once the core rgains control. (M)
 - EVENT_ONLINE removed with previous functionality available via a ModSynch
   function. Advantages over the event are that it can return a failure status
   if for example an init_bot call fails and we can unload the module. It also
   means modules that do not need to use any other events can now ignore the 
   event sub system and the core can do less event checking. (M)
 - neostats.cfg renamed to neostats.conf. This is to be more consistent with 
   other packages and to avoid someone using a config file from an older series
   with NeoStats 3.0. (M)
 - Combine standard and auth module load/unload systems so we can load and 
   unload auth modules easily. (M)
 - Remove me.onchan since it is always set with me.synched so is redundant. (M)
 - Replace me.synched references with IsNeoStatsSynched() for consistency. (M)
 - Timers now have a new type field to select the standard interval timer or 
   a midnight timer. Other types to follow. (M)
 - Timers now check module synched before running. (M)
 - Event system now uses an array per module so that issuing an event is a 
   simple (and quick) table lookup rather than parsing the whole list each 
   time. This also makes it possible for modules to add and delete events while 
   running. (M)
 - Core now handles synch checking for module events. If a module wants to
   receive an event before synch complete, they just add a flag into the event 
   table and the core will always pass the flagged event along. (M)
 - Some new list and hash functions to standardise list/hash code. (M)
 - Fake deaf mode on IRCds that do not support it natively. (M)
 - CTCP handling to send and process CTCPs easily. (M)
 - Update events and group them by type so events.h is a more useful 
   development resource. (M)
 - StatServ: Modify GeoIP for Win32 and add as a second version. (M)
 - StatServ: GeoIP lib moved to own directory. (M)
 - New debug levels of DEBUGRX and DEBUGTX to identify incoming and outgoing
   messages. (M)
 - Mode descriptions now handled core side so modules can share the information
   rather than define local variants. (M)
 - ConnectServ: mode reports now run from a table. (M)
 - More core side UMODE support. (M)
 - Add support for online bot realname, host and ident changes. (M)
 - Add support for IRCd SETNAME, SETIDENT and SETHOST functions. (M)
 - Add support for online bot nick changes. (M)
 - Combined BOTCHANLIST command with BOTLIST command. (M)
 - Remove redundant botchanhash code and tables. We can get this information
   via the bot, users structure channel list. (M)
 - Optimise bot quit paths. (M)
 - Optimise bot and associated user links to reduce lookups. (M)
 - Change module processing so we can have debug versions of DLLs. (M)
 - New Client struct introduced which contains common elememts of Server and
   User structs. Server and User specifics remain as substructs of Client. This
   makes for simpler coding for the more common elements and allows us to 
   add additional clients without major changes to the core and API with new
   substructs in the Client struct. (M)
 - IRCD feature support is now self configuring based on whether a function 
   exists to handle a feature. This means less work for IRCd coders and allows
   a protocol module to "emulate" a feature locally that would normally require
   additional core support. (M)
 - Mode processing code moved to modes.c/h (M)
 - Module API inmprovements and core flow optimisations. Functions now pass 
   valid bot and user pointers rather than looking them up multiple times. (M)
 - makeconf updated to reflect changes and some tidy ups (M)
 - Depreciate some useless config items from neostats.cfg:
   STATSERV_NETNAME - we do not use this and overwrite it when we get netinfo
   NEOSTAT_HOST - Default to servername as host and allow online config
   NEOSTAT_USER - Default to Neo and allow online config
   This makes configuration easier (M)
 - Extend BotInfo structure and simplify init_bot function to use extended 
   structure. (M)
 - Add synched field to Module structure so modules can tell when they are 
   online without having to maintain local variables and can be taken offline
   easily by the core. (M)
 - Add automatic bot_info SET options. (M)
 - Core command processor now uses a hash for SET options to speed up option
   processing. (M)
 - Add feature check to load modules so that modules will not load if the 
   selected protocol does not support a required feature. e.g. HostServ
   required SVSHOST support. (M)
 - Update auth modules so that they just calculate a level and leave the core
   to decide whether it overrides a current level. (M)
 - Reg nick support might not use mode +r so calculate the correct char when 
   loading IRCd and use variable for checking it. (M)
 - Optimise UserLevel processing so after a user level is calculated it is then
   a lookup rather than needing to recalculate every time. (M)
 - Send STATS u request to incoming servers so we can store uptime info for 
   statistics. (M)
 - Store client CTCP version reply in user struct so we can access it after the
   event. (M)
 - Send VERSION request to incoming servers so we can store version info for
   statistics. (M)
 - update hostserv to use match rather than fnmatch. (F)
 - More autotools updates to shut it up some more, and improve build process (F)
 - Update makeconf to generate a PROTOCOL line. (M)
 - Update automake files for core and protocol to observe new protocol module
   generation. (M)
 - Win32: Add debug console to GUI version with redirects of STDOUT and STDERR
   which depreciates the console version. (M)
 - Win32: Add fnmatch to core since it does not exist on Win32. (M)
 - Win32: Create protocol DLL files. (M)
 - Protocol system is now modular and required loading of a protocol module via
   neostats.cfg. (M)
 - Win32: Macros for modules/core exports for DLL compatibility. (M)
 - Win32: Create Win32 compatible dl_xxxx system for modules. (M)
 - Win32: Generate core export library for use by modules. (M)
 - New macro MSGTOK to use in protocol modules for MSG_*/TOK_* selection. (M)
 - Core no longer depends on protocol specific headers. (M)
 - Change protocol files to be more modular. Support functions accessed via
   pointers. (M)
 - Win32: Run NeoStats main code on a thread. (M)
 - Win32: Add very basic GUI. (M)
 - Win32: Disable fork. Windows handles processes differently. (M)
 - Win32: Disable unsupported signal processing. (M)
 - Win32: ADNS Win32 compatible library import. (M)
 - Win32: Macros created for *nix function not available. (M)
 - Win32: dl code disabled for first pass Win32 support. (M)
 - Win32: Socket code updated to WinSock compatible calls. (M)
 - Win32: Keeper KP_P reserved in Win32 so renamed to KP_PATH (M)
 - Win32: #define around header files not available under Win32 (M)
 - Win32: configwin32.h is a fixed config.h since Windows does not need 
   different ones. Creates problem of how to choose IRCd. (M)
 - Win32: Early support for native compilation under MSVC .NET 2003 (M)
 - Change init_bot so that in client mode, module commands and settings are
   just added to the main bot. (M)
 - Begin adding a client protocol so that NeoStats can connect as a normal
   client rather than a server. (M)
 - Split unreal and ultimate protocol files into ultimate2, ultimate3, unreal31 
   and unreal32 for easier maintainance. (M)
 - Begin moving common mode defines to neostats.h from ircd specific files. (M)
 - Channel key and limit modes now have explicit support rather than being 
   included in general mode parameters list. (M)
 - Begin improved mode handling. Protocol module tables are parsed at boot into
   a faster core lookup table. The speedup is based on the fact that more often
   than not we lookup a mode char so we can index on this char rather than loop
   through every mode multiple times looking for a match. (M)
 - Import libtools wrappers for dynamic module support (F)
 - Full AutoConf Support on the way. Core Compiles. Modules Dont yet (F)
 - Remove hard coded protocol/feature references in StatServ and HostServ. 
   These are depreciated by the new soft protocol design and will use the new
   protocol/feature references in the ModuleInfo struct where required. (M)
 - Begin replacing old #define GOTFEATURE with new FEATURE and PROTOCOL systems
   as part of soft protocol support. Currently it is still "hard" coded but 
   will eventually move to the soft support system (M)
 - Replace spart_cmd with part_bot_from_chan function (M)
 - Add BANDUMP command to display ban table (M)
 - Remove debugtochannel and optimise code path of functions using it (M)
 - Remove ssjoin_cmd and sjoin_cmd functions. All channel joins must use
   join_bot_to_chan. (M)
 - Remove snewnick_cmd function. All new users must be introduced using 
   init_bot (M)
 - Change is_pub_chan so it returns TRUE for a public channel. (M)
 - Begin IRCD "soft" protocol/feature design. (M)
 - Remove old CMODE_CH_xxx and CMODE_FL_xxx defines that new sjoin system makes
   redundant. (M)
 - Host OS value now saved by configure for use in version reporting and for 
   bug reporting. (M)
 - Add support for NOQUIT so that NeoStats can delete users from disconnected
   servers without requiring individual QUITs (M)
 - Add support to recurse server list for SQUIT so that NeoStats can delete 
   leaves of hubs which SQUIT (M)
 - Tidy exported include files (via make install) to the currently required 
   minimum. (M)
 - Added DEBUGMOD option which allows selective debugging of a module so we can
   limit debug output to a single module when required. (M)
 - Command line option -v now reports a full IRCd string in the version so we
   no longer need the flag "help" text. (M)
   this is now handled by IRCdAuth. (M)
 - Removed -l (log level) command line option. This is now an online "SET" 
   option which saved and restored via config system. (M)
 - Removed umode levels from IRCd protocol files and associated core code since 
   this is now handled by IRCdAuth. (M)
 - ExtAuth: Added support for an access list system such that the master 
   service root can manage users who have access to NeoStats and their 
   individual levels. This removes the need for the older SERVICE_ROOTS options
   which have been superseded with the new SERVICEROOT option for master root
   and the access list maintained via IRC (M)
 - Authentication modules are now optional again. A single service root is 
   required in the config file using a new SERVICEROOT option which follows the 
   format of the old SERVICE_ROOTS option but is singlular and renamed to 
   prevent upgraders relying on this working. This is used by the core to 
   provide at least one user with NeoStats access regardless of authentication 
   systems. (M)
 - Add dlog function to handle debug messages. nlog is now purely for normal 
   logging purposes (M)
 - Add DEBUGCHAN setting for sending debug messages to channel and DEBUGTOCHAN
   setting to enable/disable it's use. (M)
 - Reorganised me and config structures. (M)
 - Debug mode is now a SET option rather than a command. (M)
 - Add set command to NeoStats to set user mode for service bots. 
   /msg neostats set SERVICEBOTUMODE <mode>. default is defined in the IRCd 
   specific services_umode string. (M)
 - Add set command to NeoStats to set channel mode for service bots. 
   /msg neostats set SERVICEBOTCMODE <mode>. default is defined in the IRCd 
   specific services_cmode string. (M)
 - Add services_cmode string to IRCd protocol files to set default channel
   modes for service bot that reflect IRCd capabilities to simplify sjoin 
   code and module code for joins. (M)
 - New module auth system to support auth systems other than the 2.5 extauth.
   The core is now unable to provide any authentication and an auth module must 
   be loaded. The old IRCd umode based auth is now a loadable module so is 
   optional. Where a module wants to have local control over authentication,
   the 2.5.15+ ModAuth function has been renamed to ModLocalAuth to distinguish
   it from auth only modules. New config load module options have been added
   to support auth modules which require a slightly different style to standard
   modules. templateauth provides the example code for auth modules. (M)
 - configure now checks IRCD first so that if this required option is missed 
   the user will be told immediately rather than after all other checks. (M)
 - Build process updates so that at configure time we only do what we need to 
   and reduce the number of config.h files we need to maintain. (M)
 - New memory allocation wrappers functions scalloc, srealloc and sfree. (M)
 - Add SET VERSIONSCAN option to core for CTCP version scanning. (M)
 - StatServ: Optimise database save to further reduce code required and get 
   back a little CPU. (M)
 - StatServ: Adjust exclusions so that counts are accurate. The exclusions 
   produced cases where the current channel count was greater than the network 
   record! (M)
 - IRCd version suffix now handled by configure rather than code. (M)
 - Introduce new debug.log system to store all current messages and debug info
   to avoid corrupting main system logs when in debug mode and allow users to 
   submit this file for support rather than multiple ones from modules plus 
   core. (M)
 - StatServ: reorganised code so stats code is encapsulated from module 
   specifics and introduced new burst request system during init. (M)
 - Begin implementing "burst" request interface for modules to get current
   user/channel/server etc lists. (M)
 - Homogenize init error messages. (M)
 - Update core support functions to use new run level system to determine 
   current module removing the need for modules to pass their module pointer 
   when adding bots/timers/socks etc. (M)
 - Replace old segv_module system with new run level system. (M)
 - Keeper subdirs are now subdirs of main data dir. (M)
 - ConnectServ: reverse colour define so default is disabled. (M)
 - Core modules now use core config loading system (M)
 - All socket code now in socks.c for easier upgrade (M)
 - Early support for module semi auto config designed to perform loading of 
   module config settings or set defaults without the module having to code it. 
   Due to the need for custom set values, we will likely have to call the core 
   function from the module rather than perform automatically at load time. (M)
 - Command processor set routine broken into helper functions for easier
   maintainance (M)
 - Rewritten command processor to use new command structure (M)
 - Moved signal code to signals.c/h (M)
 - New structure for passing to commands and events (M)
 - Removed NeoStats logs command since it is useless with multiple logs. 
   Possibly look onto a LogView module sometime in the future if there is 
   demand for this facility (M)
 - Begin adding return value processing for commands so core can handle common
   errors such as syntax error (M)
 - HostServ: removed old database format support (M)
 - Event system updates. Change type to int enum for faster processing. Some 
   events renamed to be closer to irc commands so meaning is more obvious for 
   module programmers and to assist the move from module_functions to events. 
   Enum type protects event system at compile time. (M)
 - seperate auth system from main core so we can add new auth hooks (M)
 - send_sjoin bug fix where user has no modes (M)
 - Segfault reports are now directed to segfault.log rather than the main log
   files for easier submission (M)
 - subsystem structures now maintain a module pointer to lookup names rather
   than copies of the string. We can now lookup modules via a quick pointer
   compare rather than string compare and can access module information without
   addition function overheads. (M)
 - Modules must pass their module handle to the core for accessing bots/timers
   etc, once all interfaces use this system, try to "automate" the handle using
   some form of current_module/runlevel within the core (M)
 - Core and modules now share bot init code (M)
 - Updated bot interface to use a new bot_info structure (M)
 - ExtAuth: remove old format support (M)
 - Added instrinsic bot commands for ABOUT, CREDITS, VERSION (M)
 - Logging scope is now automatic rather than requiring a specific option (M)
 - Module support calls to access timers/bots/sockets etc must now pass 
   correctly typed function pointers rather than using core symbol lookups (M)
 - dl.c/h split into files dedicated to a part of the module sytstem e.g. 
   bots.c. dl.c/h now becomes our wrapper library for handling libdl plus 
   future DLL and static support (M)
 - Added some extra fields to channel, user and server structures for future 
   use (M)
 - Point of no return. Legacy 2.5 systems are now broken. Some 2.5.15 compliant
   systems will still work but all module backward compatibility has been 
   stripped. 
 - All core module changelogs moved to docs/old. Future core module updates 
   will be included in the main NeoStats changelog (M)
 - Remove module API hacks (M)
 - Remove legacy stats.h, API is now exported via neostats.h only (M)
 - Depreciate support for __module_functions and associated ModuleFunction 
   overheads, version 3.0 will send information to modules via events only (M)
 - Remove 2.5.5 and lower module compatibility systems (M)
 - New source tree layout implemented (M)
 - Begin version 3.0 development (M)
